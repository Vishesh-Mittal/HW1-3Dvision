		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Assignment 1: Surface Mesh Simplication and Subdivision</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, you will be implementing two algorithms covering: 1. Loop Subdivision 2. Quadratic Error Mesh Decimation over any 3D object. 
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_surface#Loop_subdivision_surface">Loop Subdivision</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf">Quadric Error Mesh Decimation</a></li>
			</ul>
			We have made available a visualization tool using the Three.js library implemented in "./js/assignment1.js" and an example implementation located in "./assignments/assignment1.py". Your objective is to create implementations for both "subdivision_loop" and "simplify_quadric_error". You are encouraged to use a programming language with which you are comfortable. The output results should be in the obj format, and you must visualize your outcomes accordingly. 
			<br><br>
			<b>How to Submit: </b>Please submit this template file along with your implementation as a zip file. The zip file should contain your source code, the generated results in OBJ mesh format, and a report that has been modified using this HTML file. The report should comprise your results and a concise explanation of your implementation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a GitHub repository containing all these elements and provide a link for submission.
			<br><br>
			<b>Grading: </b>The grading is based on the correctness of your implementation. You are encouraged to use the visualization tool to debug your implementation. You can also use the visualization tool to test your implementation on other 3D models. You can find an example of 3D model in the "./assets" folder.</p>

		<h2>Loop Subdivision</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Background</b>: Loop Subdivision is a surface subdivision scheme used to create smooth surfaces from coarse polygonal geometry. It's used in computer graphics for models and animations where a smoother surface representation is required. It adds new vertices (odd) along edges and updates the position of original vertices (even).
				<br><br>
				<b>Data Structure</b>: The implementation utilizes vertices (points in 3D space), faces (triangles formed by these points), and edges (lines connecting two vertices). These structures are crucial for the subdivision process, allowing for the detailed manipulation and refinement of the mesh.
				<br><br>
				<b>Design Logic</b>: The algorithm's logic includes edge identification and classification, vertex classification into even (original) and odd (new), creation and adjustment of new vertices, update of original vertex positions, and mesh reconstruction. This structured approach ensures the mesh is refined appropriately.
				<br><br>
				<b>Algorithm</b>: The Loop Subdivision method increases mesh smoothness by subdividing triangles into smaller ones and repositioning vertices. It identifies edges, classifies them, creates new vertices at midpoints, adjusts these positions for interior edges, updates original vertices based on neighbors, and applies special rules for boundary conditions.
				<br><br>
				<b>Implement Details</b>: Initially, the mesh's vertices, faces, and derived edges are prepared. Unique edges are identified, classified as interior or boundary, and new vertices are created at their midpoints. Positions of new vertices on interior edges are adjusted based on adjacent vertices. Original vertices are updated based on their neighboring vertices, with boundary vertices receiving special treatment to ensure smooth boundaries. The mesh is reconstructed with updated vertices and faces, resulting in a refined model.
				<br><br>
				<b>Special Handling for Boundary Conditions</b>: Boundary edges and vertices are treated specially to preserve the mesh shape. New vertices on boundary edges are placed at midpoints without further adjustment. Original vertices on the boundary are repositioned based on a weighted average of their position and their neighbors on the boundary, ensuring the mesh boundary remains smooth.
				<br><br>
				<b>Results</b>: Applying Loop Subdivision results in a mesh with increased vertex count and triangle density, leading to smoother surfaces and more rounded edges. The refined mesh retains the original shape but exhibits enhanced smoothness and detail, suitable for high-quality visual representations in computer graphics and animation.
